## Individual Project: The Project Shop

Hello there! This is the final iteration of my practicals as 
my Individual Project. I call it "The Project Shop". This is an
amazing website for all sorts of Robotics Projects you can find 
and can order any of the projects or project components with 
this website. It is a very comprehensive web application which
provides both direction and materials for young students to grow
and develop with.

## Features:

If you want to have a look of the features which the web application 
have explained over my video pitch. Please have a look at my link
from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXviud6CS4Y/).

These are some of the features in summary:
- Home Page --> Dynamic Cards with some text reveal on click.
- Contact Us --> Chat Feature using sockets.io.
- Projects --> Using MongoDB to access projects.
- Order Items --> Enter a form for creating an order reciept. It can also add suggestions for items as well but seperately.

## Software Required:

The following program works with the help of the following software platforms: 
1. We have developed our code using the [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Please follow the instructions from [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022#:~:text=1%20Make%20sure%20your%20computer%20is%20ready%20for,button%20to%20get%20started%20developing%20with%20Visual%20Studio.).
2. We have used [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for our Server Framework. Please refer to [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/#:~:text=Installation%20of%20Node.js%20on%20Windows%201%20Installing%20Node,your%20PC.%20Double%20click%20on%20the%20.msi%20installer.) for the installation process. 
3. Please also install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for making things much much easier! This will automatically provide you the download for your PC.

In case you already are a developer and need not to work on this, you can move on ahead!
